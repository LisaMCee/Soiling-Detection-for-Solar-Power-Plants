# Soiling-detection-for-Solar-Power-Plants
Extracts from my final project of the Propulsion Academy Data Science bootcamp as a collaboration with Nispera AG Zurich, and co-authored with [Lina Siegrist](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lina-sc/) and [Marcus Lindberg](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcuslindberg/). 

This tool was developed to detect losses from soiling at solar power plants, using power output time-series data from strings of panels, and temperature and irradiance time-series data.  
Detection of soiling losses from power output and environmental data can enable evaluation of optimal cleaning frequency without expensive soiling sensors.
